### Looking to the future
This bot is purely a utility bot, and I make updates and enhancements with that in mind.
I hope to continuously update this bot with new features for the user at my own pace, however
there are no concrete plans in place for anything specific. Suggestions can be raised via
the [support server](https://discord.gg/DPjV9xRRXb) or directly in this repo.

Thanks!
